The quantmod package for R is designed to assist the quantitative trader in the development, testing, and deployment of statistically based trading models. Retrieving data from Yahoo, we can obtain information of stock markets easliy. This semester, we would select an enterprise and track its stock price. We tend to analyse from the perspective of time series meanwhile considering real-world factors.

This April, Chinese government decided to set up a special region called *Xiong'an New Area* in Hebei province. In stock market, this policy caused several stocks to rise remarkably within a few days. These stocks are known as *Xiong'an concept stocks*. Among these we select one company, *China Fortune Land Co Ltd*, and study by means of time series. We will analyse whether the policy changes the properties of stock price series. Also, we will implement basic computations including fitting, prediction, etc.

Have fun with time series!
